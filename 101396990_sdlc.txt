Importance of Learning DevOps in SDLC

Introduction to DevOps and SDLC
DevOps is a set of practices that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development lifecycle (SDLC) and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

Benefits of DevOps in SDLC

Improved Collaboration
DevOps fosters better communication between development and operations teams, which helps reduce delays and misunderstandings during software development and deployment.

Automation and Efficiency
By automating repetitive tasks, DevOps ensures efficient and reliable processes throughout SDLC. Tools like CI/CD automate testing, building, and deployment, speeding up development cycles.

Continuous Feedback and Improvement
DevOps practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allow for frequent testing and feedback at every stage of SDLC. This ensures that issues are identified and fixed early.
