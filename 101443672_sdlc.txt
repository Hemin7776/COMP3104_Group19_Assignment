Importance of DevOps in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

DevOps plays a crucial role in the SDLC by fostering better communication between development and operations teams. This leads to faster deployment, early detection of defects, and more reliable software. DevOps also helps to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations, ensuring seamless transitions from coding to deployment.
